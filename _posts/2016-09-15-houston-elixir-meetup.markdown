Founded in September of 2016 with [crertel](https://github.com/crertel), the [Houston Elixir Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Elixir-Meetup/) provides the Houston developer community a resource for discussing Elixir, Erlang, the underlying virtual machine and related programming topics and concepts. 

You can join the community through the group's [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Elixir-Meetup/), or view prior projects on our [Github profile](https://github.com/HTX-Elixir-Meetup).
